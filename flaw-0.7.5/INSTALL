Requirements
------------

F.L.A.W. uses the SDL libraries (http://www.libsdl.org/).
This means it can run on any system supported by the SDL libraries.
To compile and run the game, the following libraries are required:

* SDL (>= 1.2)

* SDL_image 
  -libpng
  -zlib

* SDL_mixer 
  -libogg 
  -libvorbis
  -libvorbisfile

* SDL_ttf
  -libfreetype


Compile and install under Linux:
--------------------------------

Basically, all you have to do is open a terminal, 'cd' to the game's source directory
and use the following commands to configure, build and install the game:

./configure
make
make install  (as root)

Be sure you have the necessary tools and the SDL libraries installed.


Compile under Windows:
----------------------

The game can be compiled using the MinGW (http://mingw.org/) compiler.

The easiest way is to use an IDE like Code::Blocks for this (http://www.codeblocks.org/).
Basically, all you have to do is compile the source code and put the 'data' directory and 
the necessary DLL files into the directory containing the executable. 
Be sure you have the SDL development libraries set up correctly.

As an alternative you could use MinGW with a unix-like command line shell like
Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) or msys to compile the game, but this has not been
tested yet.
